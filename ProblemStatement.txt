Please follow the instructions given below for the assignment:

This is an individual assignment. It has two parts. 

Written part:

Each student is required to choose a domain of his/her interest and write down the specifications for building an information system for that domain in plain English.

Each student is assigned a TA as their point of contact. The students need to discuss their specifications with the respective TAs during November 1st week and incorporate any changes called for.
